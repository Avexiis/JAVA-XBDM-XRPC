# JAVA-XBDM-XRPC
A proof of concept that interacts with modified Xbox 360s using Java Swing GUI


This is a proof of concept tool that uses Java 8 (because it is what I had installed) to connect to a modified Xbox 360 console over TCP socket & interacts with XBDM and JRPC2/XRPC.

It currently is only capable of grabbing the console's CPU key and sending an XNotify with input message and a dropdown of icons. I explored other features but they were not yet reliable and I do not currently desire to expand this into a full project. I am posting this for anyone else to continue if they so desire.
